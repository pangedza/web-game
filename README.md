# Web Game

This repository contains a simple browser based slicing game written in vanilla JavaScript.

## Game Objective
Slice objects that appear on the screen before they disappear. The goal is to slice as many as possible to achieve a high score.

## Required Files
- `index.html` – main HTML page to open in your browser
- `script.js` – game logic written in JavaScript
- `style.css` – styles for the page

To start the game, simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). No server setup is required; you can double-click the file or drag it into the browser window.

## Controls
Use your mouse or touch screen to slice:
- **Mouse** – click and drag across the game area to cut objects
- **Touch** – swipe your finger across the screen on mobile devices

## Dependencies
This project uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are no external dependencies or build steps.

## Customization and Extension
You can modify the gameplay by editing `script.js`. Change object spawn behavior, scoring, or add new features. Update visuals in `style.css`, and extend `index.html` with additional UI elements if desired.
